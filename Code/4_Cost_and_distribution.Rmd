# Basic Setup

## Load Packages

```{r costdistpackages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(xtable)
library(weights)
library(scales)
```

## Defining Key Parameters

In this section we define key policy parameters -- the renovation rate
to be analyzed as well as upper and lower bounds to take into account
subsidies. Specifically, below the lower bound all costs will we carried
by the public sector, while above the upper bound all costs have to be
borne by private households. In between, we use linear extrapolation to
determine the subsidized share of total investment costs.

As a renovation subsidy is basically a subsidy on private wealth, we use
total net wealth as a key criterion for assessing the distributional
status of some household.

```{r keyparameters}
# policy parameters 
rate_to_be_analyzed=3 # choosing a scenario to analyze
first_percentile_to_pay <- 65/100 # policy design parameter
last_percentile_to_get_reduction <- 89/100 # policy design parameter

# supplementary parameters
perc_steps <- 100
start_year <- 2023
years_till_2050 <- 2050 - start_year
gdp_growth <- 1.01

```

## Importing Results From Past Steps

Here we import the results on the impact of renovating and refitting
residential buildings. The numbers reported at the end of the chunk
refer to the share of renovated buildings (first two lines) as well as
the share of fully renovated building relative to all buildings.

```{r importresultsbuildings}
building_outputs <-  fread(here::here(
  paste0("Intermediate_Results/immo_export_rate_", rate_to_be_analyzed, ".csv")))
immo_hp <- fread(here::here(
  paste0("Intermediate_Results/hp_share_", rate_to_be_analyzed, ".csv")))
building_outputs <- building_outputs %>% left_join(immo_hp, by = "year")

```

# Calculating Costs

## Some Key Parameters for Calculating Costs

Defining key technical parameters for calculating renovation costs. In
part, these parameters can be obtained from data on residential
buildings. Other parameters have to be reconstructed from external
sources. In our case we use total renovation costs from 2014 (as given
by the
[DIW](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.521395.de/15-49-2.pdf)),
standard inflation data from

## Compute yearly investment

The function `get_yearly_costs` upscales renovation costs per building
to costs to be expected per year all relevant scenarios.
-   prio denotes the scenario where worst performing buildings are prioritized
-   rand denotes the scenario where buildings are renovated in a random order

We consider the overall costs of renovations as calculated above and additional 
costs, which might arise from the exchange of heating systems in buildings, which 
do not require renovation otherwise.

```{r housingcostfunction}

get_yearly_costs <- function(building_results){
  building_results <- building_results %>%
    mutate(renovation_cost_prio = n_buildings * share_flats_prio * 
                                  full_renovations_prio_partial *

## Calculating Renovation Costs per House

In this section we calculate the average costs per renovated builing by
extrapolating costs from a specified base year (in our case: 2014). We
thereby take into account that different types of buildings differ in
terms of size and consider this in the extrapolation process.

```{r cost per house}

n_renovated_mfh_2014 = rate_mfh_2014 * n_mfh
n_renovated_stfh_2014 = rate_stfh_2014 * n_stfh

share_fixed = 0.25
share_variable = 1 - share_fixed
fixed_costs_2014 = cost_2014 * share_fixed / 
                   (n_renovated_stfh_2014 + n_renovated_mfh_2014)
variable_costs_stfh_2014 = cost_2014 * share_variable / 
                           (n_renovated_stfh_2014 + n_renovated_mfh_2014 * 
                            average_size_mfh / average_size_stfh ) 

cost_renovation_stfh = (fixed_costs_2014 + variable_costs_stfh_2014) * 
                        value_factor_2023
cost_renovation_mfh = (fixed_costs_2014 + variable_costs_stfh_2014 * 
                       average_size_mfh / average_size_stfh) * value_factor_2023
average_renovation_cost = (cost_renovation_stfh * n_renovated_stfh_2014 + 
                           cost_renovation_mfh * n_renovated_mfh_2014) / 
                          (n_renovated_stfh_2014 + n_renovated_mfh_2014)

cost_of_full_renovation = average_renovation_cost * value_factor_2023
```

## Calculating Renovation Costs per Year

In this section we upscale renovation costs using the function
`get_yearly_costs`, introduced in section \ref{definitions} (although
for the \textit{German case} the costs associated with refitting only
are minimal).

```{r yearlycosts}

building_outputs <- building_outputs %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(excess_hp_prio = max(prio_hp_share - full_renovations_prio_partial, 0),
         excess_hp_rand = max(rand_hp_share - full_renovations_rand_partial, 0)) %>%
  mutate(
    more_hps_prio = max(prio_hp_share - rate_io, 0),
    more_hps_rand = max(rand_hp_share - rate_io, 0)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
    
yearly_financing <- get_yearly_costs(building_outputs)
yearly_financing <- yearly_financing %>%
    filter(year > min(year),
           year < 2051)

cost_of_renovation_prio <- sum(yearly_financing$yearly_cost_prio)
cost_of_renovation_random <- sum(yearly_financing$yearly_cost_rand)
io_cost_of_renovation <- sum(yearly_financing$io_cost_prio)

```

# Distributional Analysis

## Introducing Key Functions

This first set of functions helps formatting the respective data set by
introducing percentile limits (in `ceiling_dec` and `get_percentile`).

The function `datamanipulation` extracts the relevant variables from the
[Household Finance and Consumption
Survey](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_surveys/hfcs/html/index.en.html).
If another data source has to be used, this function has to be adapted
accordingly.In detail, this function mainly reformats the data, e.g. by
recoding the absence of housing wealth from `NA` to $0$. It also sums up
all residential wealth associated with the respective household,
calculates residential wealth as share of net and gross wealth. It also
adds the income of respective households (which is not needed, but can
be employed to design alternative policy implementation strategies) and
prepares fundamentals for plotting Lorenz curves.

```{r distributionfunctions}
ceiling_dec <- function(x, level=1) round(x + 5*10^(-level-1), level)

get_percentile <- function(df, quant_steps, order_by, var_name, dec_name){
  perc_interval <- 1 / quant_steps
  dec_interval = 0.1
  df <- df %>% 
    arrange(get(order_by)) %>% 
    mutate(
      cum_weight = cumsum(weight),
      cum_weight_share = cumsum(weight) / sum(weight),
      percentile_exact = frollmean(c(0,cum_weight_share),2)[-1],
      percentile = ceiling_dec(percentile_exact,2),
      decile = ceiling_dec(percentile_exact,1)) %>%
    rename(!!var_name :=percentile,
           !!dec_name :=decile)
  return(df)
}

datamanipulation <- function(df, perc_steps){

    df <- get_percentile(df, perc_steps, 
                         "nwealth", "wealth_percentile", "wealth_decile")
    df <- get_percentile(df, perc_steps,

   df_gross <- df %>%
      arrange(gross_percentile) %>%
      mutate(lorenz = cumsum(grosswealth*weight) / sum(grosswealth*weight) * 100,
             perc = cumsum(weight) / sum(weight) * 100)
  
   df_nwealth <- df %>% 
     arrange(wealth_percentile) %>%
      mutate(lorenz = cumsum(nwealth*weight) / sum(nwealth*weight) * 100,

               perc = cumsum(weight) / sum(weight) * 100)
    
   df_income <- df %>% 
        arrange(income_percentile) %>%
        mutate(lorenz = cumsum(income_eq*weight) / sum(income_eq*weight) * 100,
               perc = cumsum(weight) / sum(weight) * 100)
    
  df_lorenz <- bind_rows(df_gross %>% select(lorenz, perc) %>% 
                           mutate(variable = "Gross Wealth"),
                          df_nwealth %>% select(lorenz, perc) %>%

                           mutate(variable = "Annual income"))
  
  return(list(df=df, df_lorenz=df_lorenz))
 }

```

This final function, `get_financing`, assesses the private and public
costs associated with the renovation efforts. Since we make different
assumption about the financing needs of private and institutional
owners, this table focuses on privately owned buildings.

```{r costassignmentfunction}

get_financing <- function(df){

    filter(immo_val != 0) %>%
    mutate(total_immo_property = immo_val * weight,

## Mapping Costs to Households

Finally, we create a loop to run all relevant functions for all
implicates in the underlying dataset, thereby considering the fact that
most datasets on private wealth are based on multiple imputation.
Multiple imputation requires to consider a small number of separate
datasets (in case of the HFCS there are five such datasets) and to
produce final estimates by meaning across across implicates.

In a first step we import and manipulate available data on private
wealth and apply the function that assigns cost to households.

```{r datamanipulation_imps, message=FALSE}

# Initialize data
imps <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Loop over imps
for (i in imps) {
  # Read CSV files
  df1 <- read_csv(here::here(paste0("Data/HFCS_countryDE_imp", i, ".csv")),
                  show_col_types = FALSE)
  df2 <- read_csv(here::here(paste0("Data/HFCS_countryDE_imp", i, "_income.csv")),
                  show_col_types = FALSE)
  
  # Join data frames and manipulate data
  HFCS <- full_join(df1, df2) %>%
    mutate(imp = i)
  
  manipulated_data <- datamanipulation(HFCS, perc_steps)
  
  # Collect data implicates
  if (i == 1) {
    collect_data_implicates <- manipulated_data$df
  } else {
    collect_data_implicates <- full_join(collect_data_implicates, 
                                         manipulated_data$df)
  }
  
  # Get financing results and manipulate financing table
  finance_results <- get_financing(manipulated_data$df)
  financing_table <- finance_results$table
  financing_table$implicate <- i
  
  # Collect results in result_table
  if (i == 1) {
    result_table <- financing_table
  } else {
    result_table <- merge(result_table, financing_table, all = TRUE)
  }
}

```

In a second step we collect results across all implicates to calculate
final estimates.

```{r collectingresults_imps}
imp_m <- result_table %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    total_cost_prio = mean(total_cost_prio),
    yearly_prio = mean(yearly_prio),
    yearly_io_prio = mean(yearly_io_prio),
    total_cost_random = mean(total_cost_random),
    yearly_random = mean(yearly_random),
    yearly_io_random = mean(yearly_io_random),
    share_private = mean(share_private),
    share_state = mean(share_state),
    total_public_prio = mean(total_public_prio),
    yearly_public_prio = mean(yearly_public_prio),
    total_public_random = mean(total_public_random),
    yearly_public_random = mean(yearly_public_random)
  ) 

```

Finally, we export the results.

```{r exportresults}
outpath_results <- here::here("Results/hfcs_results.csv")
fwrite(imp_m, outpath_results)
out_table_results <- xtable(imp_m)

outpath_io_results <- here("Intermediate_Results/results_for_io.csv")
fwrite(yearly_financing, outpath_io_results)
out_table_results <- xtable(imp_m)
```
